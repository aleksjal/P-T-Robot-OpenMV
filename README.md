Hardware.

1. OpenMV Cam H7 Plus (https://openmv.io/collections/cams/products/openmv-cam-h7-plus)
2. 2 Sets Pan Tilt Servo Mount Bracket (https://www.amazon.com/Servo-Mount-Bracket-MG996R-Steering/dp/B07PQ12TXS/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3IO348ENA9XEH&keywords=pan+and+tilt&qid=1682815811&sprefix=pan+and+tilt%2Caps%2C126&sr=8-6)
3. Servo Motor MG995/M996 - 2 servos
4. Power for servos. Any battery pack, I used 4xAA eneloop pro accu 1.2v each, inside battery box and soldered power switch on a positive wire, to manage power across projects I used the proto-board which comes with OpenMV vision sensor and some power output terminations of different types so I can easyly provide different types of projects with power source.
