Hardware.

1. OpenMV Cam H7 Plus (https://openmv.io/collections/cams/products/openmv-cam-h7-plus)
2. 2 Sets Pan Tilt Servo Mount Bracket (https://www.amazon.com/Servo-Mount-Bracket-MG996R-Steering/dp/B07PQ12TXS/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3IO348ENA9XEH&keywords=pan+and+tilt&qid=1682815811&sprefix=pan+and+tilt%2Caps%2C126&sr=8-6)
3. Servo Motor MG995/M996 - 2 servos
4. Power for servos. Any battery pack, I used 4xAA inside battery box and soldered power switch on a positive wire, to manage power across projects I used the proto-board which comes with OpenMV vision sensor and some power output terminations of different types so I can easyly provide different types of projects with power source.  
5. Some wires, face or two, bolts and nuts or something else to securely mount H7 to tilt bracket...

optional

6. I used raspberry pi zero 2 W to run OpenMV IDE, because I needed mobility for another project, but any computer is okay. 

Building.

1. Assemble Pan&Tilt with servos. I used 2 sets of brackets to firmly mount mechanism to the robot chassis, I had some brackets to mount the sensor, and in the box you ll find nice acrylyc mount frame with 4 sets of M3.
